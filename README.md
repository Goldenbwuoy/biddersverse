# About Biddersverse

-   Biddersverse is a multivendor online auction application for consumer electronic products.

-   Sellers can create listings for bidders to bid on. Bidding takes place within a period of time specified by the seller.

-   At the end of the auction, the system automatically notifies the winning bidder and the seller by email.

-   All sellers must have Stripe accounts to be able to post listings.

-   The winning bidders can pay for the won items (the system only supports card payments for now).

-   A user can use the same account for both selling items and bidding. To be able to sell items, a user needs to activate seller account features in the profile settings (This step requires the user to have a Stripe account or create one).
